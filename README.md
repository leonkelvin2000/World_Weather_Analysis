# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview

- We have been tasked with three deliverables that will create a few changes to take the PlanMyTrip app to the next level.

- Jack and the beta testers love it and have task us to take their feedback to further improve the app.

## Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
-Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data you gathered in this module, use your API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

-The information on each city was received via an API from a website call "open weather map" that has information on cities across the world. This information was required for Deliverable 2.

## Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destination Map
Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

## Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.

## Conclusion
With these additions to to app, users can now use to help them plan a trip, with a little more information on where they may go and some details about each location.
